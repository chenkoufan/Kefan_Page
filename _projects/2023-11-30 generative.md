        <p>In the final design, I would like to use the magnetic field to simulate the flow of people in a simple way, for example, different objects such as the different design of the wall will give the effect of attraction/repulsion, so that the different layout will also have an impact on the way of people's flow, and this can be used to explore the possible effects of the layout in the plane.</p>

        <p>After that, we add two strong categories of attraction and repulsion, and use camera in combination with OpenCV to give the design interactive properties combining physical and virtual.</p>
