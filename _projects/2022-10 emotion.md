            <p>The epidemic shock and strict policies have caused great inconvenience
to people, leading to serious negative emotions among the citizens. They
vent their emotions on social media, which also affects their surroundings
in time and space, causing the transmission of moods to become a
phenomenon that cannot be ignored.
Therefore, | proposed the concept of excess emotion to investigate
whether sentiment spread has spillover effect in time and space. Since
2022, the negative sentiment of citizens reached its peak due to the
difficulty of controlling the epidemic in Shenzhen and the prolonged
living control. So, we choose to that time period as the research target
and study the spillover effect of emotions by building OLS models.
